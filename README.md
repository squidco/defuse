# Defuse!

Defuse a bomb or defend it! This app allows you to set a timer for a bomb and start a round. It was made because I wanted to play Rainbow 6 Siege with my friends irl with nerf guns.

# Installation

Not much to do here just run the site [here](https://squiddotjpeg.github.io/defuse/).

# Usage

Enter a custom value in the time entry field
After the times are set just hit the button to start the round and the bomb timer will start counting down
If the bomb goes off the defenders win but you can also hold down the big red button to plant the defuser if you're an attacker
If you plant the defuser as an attacker a new timer will start and at at the end of that countdown the attackers will win
The defenders will have to "destroy the defuser" in order to win the round
