# Defuse!

This app is a BOMB! Not really. Maybe. It's designed to do two things: blow up or be defused.

# Installation

Not much to do here just run the site [here](https://squiddotjpeg.github.io/defuse/).

# Usage

Enter a custom value in the time entry field or select one the buttons to use a preset value. 
You can also set your own preset values that will be saved in local storage. You may also select a custom delay before the bomb activates as a sort of preround timer. 

## Screenshot here

After the delay finishes its countdown the bomb timer will start. When the bomb timer finishes its countdown the bomb explodes and the round ends.

## Screenshots here

If an attacker makes it to the bomb they can activate the defuse sequence which will start either a timer or a sequence of events:

The events are interactible and will deactivate the bomb if all done properly and in the correct order. The timer will simply count down unless the defenders "destroy" it.
